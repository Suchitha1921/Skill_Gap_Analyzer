JobReady: Bridging the Skill Gap for Aspiring Developers
🚀 A Python-based application that helps aspiring tech professionals identify skill gaps and provides personalized learning roadmaps.

📌 Overview
JobReady is an innovative capstone project built as part of the IDC 30 Days of Python Challenge (Day 30).
Our goal was to create a tool that empowers junior developers, final-year students, fresh graduates, bootcampers, and career switchers by:

✅ Helping them identify the exact skills required for their chosen tech role
✅ Enabling self-assessment of current skill levels
✅ Providing visual insight into skill gaps
✅ Generating personalized learning roadmaps to bridge those gaps

💡 Problem Statement
Aspiring tech professionals often face:

❌ Unclear understanding of essential skills

❌ Frustration from mismatched job applications

❌ Lack of a focused, personalized learning plan

JobReady simplifies the journey from learning to employment by offering clarity and guidance.
